# Start project gingko
# Gingko is a point to point rsync rolling checksum proto-
# col implemented file synchronize application. Instead
# of original rsync builds, we want to make it able to 
# sync files from a large mesh computer network so-called 
# the cloud and pushing files from computers to computers,
# the P2P protocol will make it more efficient.
# Hope it success!
